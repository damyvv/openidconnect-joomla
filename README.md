# \*\*UNOFFICIAL\*\* OpenID Connect Joomla plugin
This plugin allows you to use OpenID Connect for the user authentication. 
Note that this is an extension and not a replacement for the internal user 
database. When a user logs in for the first time, a new user will be created
in the joomla database.

**This plugin has had very limited testing. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

Features:
- Tested with keycloak
- Role management from the authentication server
- Administrator panel **NOT** affected
- Works with either the standard login form or with redirect to allow SSO

**Redirection URL for SSO login**
```
/index.php?option=com_openidconnect&task=login
```
